Appogeddon is a site dedicated to monthly reviews of the top AppStore apps. It provides a high level overview of free, paid and grossing apps in all categories or a particular category posted every month. 

The word Appogeddon is a made up word that is supposed to mean the final battle of apps. Today, the AppStore is nothing but the war of apps - some reach the top pulling others down until most vanish in this battle. 

Appogeddon was created by New York based architect and enterpreneur Vadym Ustymenko and his creative mindful thinker and partner in life Kateryna Ustymenko. If you have any feedback, questions or suggestions, please reach out to us using the Contact link.
